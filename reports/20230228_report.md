In January, `#include ＜C++＞` received a report of multiple allegations against an Organiser.

None of the allegations were related to behaviour on this server, at `#include ＜C++＞` events, or
while representing `#include ＜C++＞`. `#include ＜C++＞` is committed to encouraging historically
disadvantaged people in C++, and takes reports of this kind very seriously. Our Code of Conduct is
on our [website][1].

After reviewing the reported incidents, and receiving a report from the CoC team of one of the
conferences involved, the `#include ＜C++＞` Code of Conduct team has decided that these incidents
displayed a problem understanding boundaries or a problem respecting them. As a result of these
deliberations, we have removed all roles of `#include ＜C++＞` authority and trust from the Organiser.
The former Organiser will retain access to our public technical channels.

For details of role terminology used in this report, please refer to [this page][2].
