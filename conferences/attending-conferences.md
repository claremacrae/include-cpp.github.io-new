Since our founding, `#include <C++>` members have been attending conferences and working to make them more inclusive.

## Conference Tables

We typically have a table or exhibit booth, where we sell <a class="page-link" href="/shop/">merchandise</a>, give away stickers, and answer questions about inclusion and diversity. This table is generally a great place to meet other attendees who you can be confident will be welcoming and friendly.
