[We have been heavily involved with CppCon in the past years; our involvement is currently suspended](https://www.includecpp.org/posts/)

## For conference attendees

- We have a [friendly presence at conferences](/conferences/attending-conferences).
- We offer help for minorities and junior programmers with [scholarships to attend major conferences](/conferences/scholarships). You can apply for scholarships, and donate to them.

## For conference organisers

- Help for conferences in reaching minority groups with calls for papers, and suggesting candidates to invite to speak and <a class="page-link" href="/conferences/organising-conferences/">running an inclusive conference</a>.
- A [toolbox for C++ conference organisers](https://github.com/include-cpp/toolboxes/releases/latest) to improve diversity and inclusion.
- We also have a lot of [links and other resources](/resources/domains/conferences/) that are helpful to anyone running a conference.
